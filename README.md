# SAMStarListView

Is iOS component for drawing stars and reacting to touches.

No images, all graphics is done by CoreGraphics :)

## Dynamic properties:

- number of stars (property `count`)
- number of selected stars (property `countOfSelected`)
- color (property `strokeColor`)
- empty color (see difference in images) (property `emptyColor`)


5 stars with 3 selected, no empty color:
